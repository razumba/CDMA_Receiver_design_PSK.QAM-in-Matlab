function  tx_filter 
%TX_FILTER reconstruct the analog signal by using the ideal low-pass filter 
%coorperating with the input symbols and zero inserting  
%
%   [ s ] = tx_filter(d,par_tx_w,switch_graph)
%
%   'par_tx_w' is the oversampling for the zero inserting, e.g., par_tx_w = 8.
%
%   Switchable graph of the output of the ideal low-pass filter with
%   On:  switch_graph = 1;
%   Off: switch_graph = 0;
