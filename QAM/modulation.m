function  modulation
%MODULATION modulates the input binary signal with different mapping scheme
%
%   [ d ] = modulation(c, switch_mod, switch_graph)
%
%   The modulation schemes considered here are 16QAM and 16PSK with the
%   indicator switch_mod. Other modulation schemes are not considered here.
%   The normalization of the average symbol power is also considered
%   here.
%
%   16QAM: switch_mod = 0;
%   16PSK: switch_mod = 1;
%
%   The parameter 'switch_graph' is used to control the function to
%   draw the Constellation of modulated symbols w.r.t 16QAM and 16PSK.
%
%   On:  switch_graph = 1;
%   Off: switch_graph = 0;
