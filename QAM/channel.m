function channel
%CHANNEL generats the baseband channel for this lab
%
%   [y] = channel(x, par_SNRdB, switch_graph)
%
%   The baseband channel here is Additive Gaussian White Noise,
%   which is generated according to the input signal x and the input
%   Signal-to-NOise ratio(SNR) par_SNRdB. 
%
%   The parameter 'switch_graph' is used to control the swtichable figure for
%   displaying the output of the baseband channel:
%   On:  switch_graph = 1;
%   Off: switch_graph = 0;
